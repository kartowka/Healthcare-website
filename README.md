# ProjectManagement

## Overview
The following project simulates the Agile software development methodology, we are continuously building a website where in each sprint we add new features and possibilities :sunglasses:.

### Introduction
#### Sprint Nº 1
In the first sprint we've built a skeleton structure for our website, it has basic features like a nav bar, log-in page (with no database connection as of yet) and other stub buttons like `Services`, `About` etc.

Furthermore, we've built a custom page for `not found` pages i.e., `404` page.

The log-in page has a syntax authentication Email & Password fields.
- Password length has to be longer than 7 characters.


#### Sprint Nº 2
In this sprint, we mainly wrote system requirements & test cases accordingly while covering (hopefully) at least 95% of our to-be-built system. All requirements were uploaded to our project management workplace at [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/) to their respective Epic.

We changed the website stub from Sprint 1 to one that resembles more a health care system.
