# ProjectManagement

## Overview
The following project simulates the Agile software development methodology, we are continuously building a website where in each sprint we add new features and possibilities :sunglasses:.

### Introduction
#### Sprint NÂº 1
In the first sprint we've built a skeleton structure for our website, it has basic features like a nav bar, log-in page (with no database connection as of yet) and other stub buttons like `Services`, `About` etc.

Furthemore, we've built a custom page for `not found` pages i.e `404` page.

The log-in page has a syntax authentication Email & Password fields.
- Password length has to be longer than 7 characters.
